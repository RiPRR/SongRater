I think my brain is rotting in places
I think my heart is ready to die
I think my body is falling in pieces
I think my blood is passing me by

Honey, what'd you take, what'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?

I think my fate is losing it's patience
I think the ground is pulling me down
I think my life is losing momentum
I think my ways are wearing me down

But if I gave up on being pretty, I wouldn't know how to be alive
I should move to a brand new city and teach myself how to die

Honey, what'd you take, what'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?

Honey, what'd you take, what'd you take?
Honey, look at me
Tell me what you took, what'd you take?
